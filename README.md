# BasicNHibernate
Basic NHibernate project with a basic domain and repository. XML NHibernate configuration and mapping. NUnit tests.

This project is simply a copy of the tutorial for NHibernate found at http://nhibernate.info/doc/tutorials/first-nh-app/your-first-nhibernate-based-application.html. It has been updated slightly to use the latest versions of NHibernate and NUnit at the time of writing.
